    <h1> Week 0 Recap</h1>
    <p>We got to know each other by playing games and wrote our first lines of HTML. We made a video for the weekly challenge and learned the difference between backend and frontend. We applied algorithmic thinking to explain the process of making coffee and learned about DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion). Additionally, we talked about how to give feedback and discussed the theory of perception.</p>
