    <h1> Week 0 Recap</h1>
    <p>We got to know each other by playing games and wrote our first lines of HTML. We made a video for the weekly
        challenge and learned the difference between backend and frontend. We applied algorithmic thinking to explain
        the process of making coffee and learned about DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion). Additionally, we talked about
        how to give feedback and discussed the theory of perception.</p>
